# NFL Fantasy Breakout Prediction: Composite Scoring vs Machine Learning

## Blog Post Outline: Transparent Rules vs Black-Box ML

This analysis explores a fundamental question in predictive modeling: How does a transparent, rule-based composite scoring approach compare against black-box machine learning methods for predicting NFL fantasy football breakouts?

## The Composite Scoring Approach

### Scientific Framework
Our composite model follows established methodologies:

**Linear Weighted Scoring Models**
- Factor selection and validation based on fantasy football fundamentals
- Weight determination through historical performance analysis
- Score normalization across disparate metrics
- Performance evaluation against actual fantasy outcomes

**Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)**
- Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) for combining factors
- Transparent scoring that explains exactly why players rank high or low
- Domain knowledge naturally integrated through weight selection

## Key Comparison Dimensions

### Interpretability vs Performance Trade-off
- **Composite Model**: Complete transparency - every score component is visible and adjustable
- **ML Models**: Potentially better predictive accuracy but operates as a "black box"

### Overfitting Resistance
- **Composite Model**: Fewer parameters may generalize better to new seasons
- **ML Models**: Risk of learning noise in training data, especially with limited NFL sample sizes

### Domain Knowledge Integration
- **Composite Model**: Expert knowledge directly encoded in weight selection
- **ML Models**: Learns patterns purely from data, may miss football-specific context

### Adaptability
- **Composite Model**: Linear relationships, may miss complex interactions
- **ML Models**: Captures non-linear patterns and factor interactions automatically

## Scientific Methodology for Evaluation

### Data Splitting Strategy
- Proper train/validation/test splits using historical seasons
- Composite model weights determined via domain expertise or optimization on training data
- ML models trained on same training set for fair comparison

### Cross-Validation
- K-fold cross-validation across multiple seasons
- Ensure robust performance estimates for both approaches

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for breakout/non-breakout
- **Regression**: MAE, RMSE for fantasy point predictions
- **Ranking**: Spearman correlation, NDCG for player rankings
- **Calibration**: Reliability diagrams for probability predictions

### Statistical Significance Testing
- Paired t-tests for performance differences
- McNemar's test for classification agreement
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for metric estimates

### Bias-Variance Analysis
- Examine prediction stability across different samples
- Understand each method's consistency and reliability
