# QB College Starts vs Career Wins Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This pipeline analyzes the relationship between college quarterback starts and NFL career success, specifically focusing on starting QBs for each team and their career win totals.

## Data Collection Strategy

### 1. Current NFL Starting QBs
**Data Sources:**
- **ESPN API**: Real-time depth charts and roster data
- **Pro Football Reference**: Current season starting lineups
- **NFL.com API**: Official roster and depth chart data
- **Sports Reference API**: Historical and current roster data

**Key Fields:**
- Team
- QB Name
- Position on depth chart
- Games started (current season)

### 2. College Career Data
**Data Sources:**
- **College Football Reference**: Historical college stats
- **Sports Reference College Football**: Complete college career data
- **NCAA Statistics Database**: Official college statistics
- **CFB Stats API**: Programmatic access to college football data

**Key Metrics:**
- Total college starts
- College wins as starter
- Years played in college
- College team(s)
- Conference played in

### 3. NFL Career Wins
**Data Sources:**
- **Pro Football Reference**: Complete NFL career statistics
- **NFL API**: Official career statistics
- **nflverse/nflfastR**: R package with comprehensive NFL data
- **Stathead**: Premium sports data API

**Key Metrics:**
- Total NFL wins as starter
- Regular season wins
- Playoff wins
- Win percentage
- Years in NFL

## Data Pipeline Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition
```python
# Pseudo-code structure
def get_current_starters():
    """Pull current starting QBs for all 32 teams"""
    # ESPN depth charts
    # Cross-reference with recent game data
    return starter_list

def get_college_stats(qb_name):
    """Retrieve college career statistics"""
    # Query CFB Stats API
    # Parse college starts and wins
    return college_data

def get_nfl_career_wins(qb_name):
    """Get NFL career win totals"""
    # Query Pro Football Reference
    # Calculate total wins as starter
    return nfl_wins
```

### Phase 2: Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardize names, handle transfers, account for multiple colleges
- **Data Matching**: Link college and NFL records accurately
- **Data Validation**: Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy

### Phase 3: Analysis
- Correlation between college starts and NFL wins
- Success rate by college conference
- Threshold analysis (minimum college starts for NFL success)
- Outlier identification (high/low performers)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Web Scraping Setup
```python
# Libraries needed
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import nfl_data_py as nfl
```

### Step 2: API Integration
- Register for necessary API keys
- Set up rate limiting
- Implement error handling

### Step 3: Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE qb_analysis (
    player_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    player_name VARCHAR(100),
    current_team VARCHAR(50),
    college_starts INT,
    college_wins INT,
    nfl_career_wins INT,
    nfl_games_started INT,
    draft_year INT,
    draft_round INT
);
```

## Data Sources Research

### Primary Sources
1. **nflverse ecosystem** (R/Python)
   - `nflfastR`: Play-by-play data with QB stats
   - `nflreadr`: Simplified data access
   - Includes game results and starter information

2. **College Football Data API**
   - Free tier available
   - REST API with player career stats
   - Endpoint: `https://api.collegefootballdata.com/`

3. **Pro Football Reference Scraping**
   - BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
   - Career game logs available
   - Starting QB records by game

### Secondary Sources
- **ESPN Hidden API**: Undocumented but accessible
- **The Football Database**: Historical data
- **Sports Database**: Aggregated statistics

## Analysis Metrics

### Key Questions to Answer
1. What's the correlation coefficient between college starts and NFL wins?
2. Is there a minimum threshold of college starts for NFL success?
3. Which colleges produce the most successful NFL QBs by this metric?
4. Do QBs with more college starts have longer NFL careers?
5. How do early-entry QBs compare to 4-year starters?

### Visualization Plans
- Scatter plot: College starts (X) vs NFL wins (Y)
- Box plots: NFL wins grouped by college start ranges
- Heat map: Success rate by college/conference
- Time series: Evolution of this relationship over draft years

## Technical Considerations

### Data Challenges
- **Name matching**: Different name formats across databases
- **Transfer QBs**: Multiple colleges for some players
- **Historical data**: Incomplete records for older players
- **Active players**: Ongoing career statistics

### Solution Approaches
- Fuzzy string matching for names
- Aggregate total college starts across schools
- Focus on recent era (2000-present) for consistency
- Update mechanism for active player stats

## Output Format

### Final Dataset Structure
```csv
player_name,current_team,college,college_starts,college_wins,nfl_wins,nfl_starts,win_pct
Patrick Mahomes,KC,Texas Tech,32,18,64,80,0.800
Josh Allen,BUF,Wyoming,37,21,52,75,0.693
...
```
