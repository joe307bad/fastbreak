## Retrosheet to Sabermetrics

### Overview
Converting Retrosheet's play-by-play data into point-in-time sabermetrics for comprehensive game context analysis. Each calculation must reflect the statistical state at the moment before each game, creating a temporal snapshot of team and player performance.

### Phase 1: Win Streak Analysis
**Objective**: Calculate team win/loss streaks at game time
- Parse chronological game results from event files (.EVE)
- Track consecutive wins/losses leading up to each game
- Handle series breaks and season boundaries
- Output: `CurrentWinStreak` (positive) or `CurrentLossStreak` (negative)

### Phase 2: Starting Pitcher Metrics (Point-in-Time)
**Objective**: Calculate pitcher ERA, WHIP, FIP, and WAR before each start
- **ERA**: Earned runs Ã— 9 Ã· innings pitched (season-to-date)
- **WHIP**: (Walks + hits) Ã· innings pitched
- **FIP**: ((13Ã—HR) + (3Ã—BB) - (2Ã—K)) Ã· IP + FIP constant
- **WAR**: Wins Above Replacement using innings pitched and run prevention
- Parse individual pitcher event data from play-by-play records
- Calculate cumulative stats from season start to current game date

### Phase 3: Impact Player Offensive Metrics
**Objective**: Calculate key position player stats at game time
- **OPS**: On-base percentage + slugging percentage
- **wOBA**: Weighted on-base average using linear weights
- **WAR**: Offensive + defensive + baserunning + positional value
- **ISO**: Isolated power (slugging - batting average)
- Identify "impact players" (top 3-4 position players by plate appearances)
- Calculate running totals from season start to current game

### Phase 4: Advanced Team Metrics
**Objective**: Generate team-level sabermetrics for game context
- **Team wRC+**: Weighted runs created adjusted for park/league
- **Defensive Efficiency**: Outs recorded Ã· balls in play
- **Base Running Value**: Extra bases taken vs. expected
- **Clutch Performance**: Performance in high-leverage situations
- **Recent Form**: Weighted performance over last 10-15 games

### Phase 5: Environmental Context Integration
**Objective**: Incorporate park factors and weather impact
- Parse weather data from event files (temperature, wind, precipitation)
- Apply park factors from reference files
- Calculate home field advantage metrics
- Day vs. night game performance differentials

### Implementation Considerations
- **Temporal Accuracy**: All stats calculated using only games prior to current date
- **Data Validation**: Handle missing data and statistical edge cases
- **Performance**: Optimize for processing 100+ years of baseball data
- **Accuracy**: Cross-validate against published statistics where available

## Retrosheet Integration with Elo+ Ratings

### How Enhanced Features Improve Elo Adjustments

The ML model doesn't directly change Elo ratings - instead, it uses confidence scores to create **Elo adjustments** that modify how much teams gain/lose after each game. The Retrosheet sabermetrics data dramatically enhances this process:

#### Current Elo+ Process
1. **Traditional Elo**: Teams gain/lose points based on wins/losses (typically Â±16-32 points)
2. **ML Confidence Score**: Model predicts game outcome with confidence (0.0-1.0)  
3. **Elo Adjustment**: Confidence score creates modifier (currently Â±11 point range)

#### Enhanced Process with Retrosheet Data

**Example Game: Boston Red Sox vs New York Yankees**

**Traditional Elo Only:**
- Red Sox win: +24 points
- Yankees lose: -24 points

**With Enhanced ML Features:**
```
ML Model Input:
- Elo difference: Yankees +45
- Win streak: Red Sox on 6-game streak
- Starting pitchers: Sale (2.85 ERA, 3.2 WAR) vs Cole (3.20 ERA, 2.8 WAR)
- Key players: Devers (145 wRC+) vs Judge (180 wRC+)  
- Weather: 15mph wind blowing out
- Park factor: Fenway favors lefties (Sale)
- Recent form: Red Sox 8-2 last 10, Yankees 4-6 last 10

ML Confidence: 72% Red Sox win (higher than Elo alone predicted)
```

**Elo Adjustment Result:**
- High confidence = larger rating adjustments
- Red Sox win gets **+28 points** (instead of +24)
- Yankees lose **-28 points** (instead of -24)
- Model "rewards" the upset more because it correctly identified Red Sox advantages

### Key Enhancement Benefits

1. **Momentum Recognition**: Win streaks and recent form help identify when teams are playing above/below their rating
2. **Injury Impact**: Star player absence (low WAR contributions) significantly affects expected performance  
3. **Matchup Advantages**: Specific pitcher vs. lineup strengths (lefty vs. righty, power vs. finesse)
4. **Environmental Factors**: Weather and park effects that traditional Elo completely misses
5. **Situational Context**: Clutch performance and high-leverage situation data

### Expected Performance Improvements

- **Current Accuracy**: 60% (vs 52% baseline)
- **With Retrosheet Features**: Projected 65-68% accuracy
- **Better Calibration**: More accurate confidence scores lead to more precise Elo adjustments
- **Reduced Variance**: Point-in-time stats eliminate end-of-season statistical noise

The richer the ML features, the better the model identifies when upsets are "actually not upsets" - leading to more accurate rating adjustments over time and faster convergence to true team strength.

## Data Generation Pipeline

### Overview
While Retrosheet provides comprehensive play-by-play data, it doesn't include pre-calculated sabermetrics. We need a data generation pipeline that produces CSV files matching the `test.csv` structure with all necessary features for the Elo+ system.

### Required Output Format (30 columns)
```csv
GameId,Date,HomeTeam,AwayTeam,HomeScore,AwayScore,Temperature,WindSpeed,WindDirection,Precipitation,HomePitcherName,HomePitcherERA,HomePitcherWHIP,HomePitcherK,HomePitcherBB,HomePitcherIP,AwayPitcherName,AwayPitcherERA,AwayPitcherWHIP,AwayPitcherK,AwayPitcherBB,AwayPitcherIP,HomeOPS,AwayOPS,HomeWOBA,AwayWOBA,HomeERAPlus,AwayERAPlus,HomeFIP,AwayFIP
```

### Data Source Strategy

#### Option 1: Multiple Data Source Integration
**Primary Sources:**
- **Baseball Reference** - Historical team/player stats, park factors
- **FanGraphs** - Advanced sabermetrics (FIP, WAR, wRC+, etc.)
- **Weather APIs** - Historical weather data for game locations
- **MLB Stats API** - Recent game results and basic stats

**Challenges:**
- API rate limits and data availability
- Inconsistent data formats across sources
- Historical data gaps (pre-2000s sabermetrics)
- Point-in-time calculation complexity

#### Option 2: Retrosheet + Sabermetrics Calculation Engine
**Approach:**
- Use Retrosheet play-by-play as foundation
- Build calculation engine for sabermetrics from raw events
- Generate point-in-time stats for each game date
- Integrate weather data from historical APIs

**Phases:**
1. **Parse Retrosheet Events** - Extract game results, player actions
2. **Calculate Basic Stats** - Batting averages, ERAs, innings pitched
3. **Derive Advanced Metrics** - FIP, WAR, wOBA, wRC+ from formulas
4. **Point-in-Time Assembly** - Generate stats as they existed at game time
5. **Weather Integration** - Match historical weather to game locations/dates

#### Option 3: BaseballR Package Integration
**Approach:**
- **R baseballr Package**: Point-in-time sabermetrics from Baseball-Reference
- **Data Coverage**: Historical data back to 1994 (some functions to 1992)
- **Functions**: `bref_daily_pitcher()` and `bref_daily_batter()` for date ranges
- **Output**: 46+ columns of comprehensive stats including advanced metrics

**Key Functions:**
```r
bref_daily_pitcher("2024-04-01", "2024-04-01")  # Single game date
bref_daily_batter("2024-04-01", "2024-04-01")   # Point-in-time batting stats
```

**Advantages:**
- Pre-calculated sabermetrics (wOBA, FIP, WHIP, advanced metrics)
- Point-in-time accuracy (stats as of specific date)
- No complex calculation engine required
- Comprehensive 46-column dataset per function call

**Implementation Strategy:**
