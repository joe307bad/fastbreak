We're excited to launch fastbreak, a new way to explore sports analytics.

## Why fastbreak?

Sports data is everywhere, but it's often locked behind paywalls, buried in clunky interfaces, or just plain slow. We built fastbreak to fix that.

## What makes us different

- **Fast** - Pages load instantly with static generation
- **Cross-platform** - Web, iOS, and Android
- **Free** - No subscriptions, no ads
- **Interactive** - Explore data your way

## What's next

We're just getting started. Expect more sports, more charts, and more ways to dig into the data you care about.

Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KtqmASc6jn) to share feedback and help shape the future of fastbreak.
