## 1. College basketball features

- ✅ Matchup worksheets for AP top 25 matchups [[tweet]](https://x.com/joe307bad/status/2023973398099984711)
- ✅ AP Top 25 progression over the season [[tweet]](https://x.com/joe307bad/status/2023975956214317555?s=20)
- ⏳ Daily updating bracket from March through the championship in April. Bracket should have matchup worksheets for all the games.

## 2. NBA and NHL trends and charts

- ✅ "One month trend" camparison chart for each NBA matchup over the next 7 days that includes stats for points per game, net rating, and other advanced stats. [[user guide]](/docs/guide#matchup-worksheet)
- ✅ Comparison charts for each NBA matchup over the next 7 days that compares each teams cumulative net rating ver the season and their defensive vs offensive rating over the past 10 weeks. [[user guide]](/docs/guide#matchup-worksheet)
- ⏳ NHL matchup worksheets with trends and charts
- Results view what shows the results of the past week. It will be similar to the matchup worksheets but with a way of dispkaying the outcome of the game when it becomes available.

## 3. Web project parity: sharing, filtering, matchup worksheets, pinning teams and storing in local storage

Bringing the mobile app's most powerful features to the web platform, including the ability to share custom visualizations with colleagues, filter data by relevant parameters, create detailed matchup analysis worksheets, and save favorite teams for quick access.

## 4. Daily summaries and insights based on Google search results and backed by fastbreak charts

- ✅ Beta demonstrating using Gemini with grounded search to summarize 2 narratives for 5 sports (NBA, NHL, CBB, MLB, and NFL). Each narrative tries to outline a statistical analysis based on fasbtreak charts. [[user guide]](/docs/guide#topics)
- A mechanism for battling the same topics everyday. This has pros and cons. I like being reminded of the progress of certain news topics everyday. Other topics are not useful to hear about repeatedly.

## 5. Push notifications when there are updated charts

A user specified, in-app setting that notifies the user when the topics have been generated and gives a quick snapshot of those topics in the push notification message.

## 6. Selectable themes for major teams

Allowing users to select a theme that correlates to a given team, with that theme affecting the entire fastbreak UI.
