# Fastbreak

A sports analytics platform with advanced Elo+ rating system for baseball analysis.

## Elo+ Rating System Brainstorm

### Overview
The Elo+ system is a two-pass machine learning approach that extends traditional Elo ratings by incorporating advanced baseball analytics and environmental factors.

### Architecture

#### Current CLI Structure
- **F# CLI Application** (`server/src/Fastbreak.Cli/`)
- **Current Commands**: âœ… `generate-elo-plus`, ðŸ”² `predict-game`, ðŸ”² `convert-retrosheet`
- **Framework**: Argu for command-line parsing
- **Target**: .NET 9.0

#### Implementation Status

##### 1. âœ… Remove Example Commands
- âœ… Remove existing `Export_Leaderboard` and `Export_Stats` commands
- âœ… Clean up DataExport.fs module (renamed to EloPlus.fs)

##### 2. âœ… New CLI Command: `generate-elo-plus`
```
fastbreak-cli generate-elo-plus [options]

Options:
  --file <path>           CSV file path for game data (optional, uses sample data if not specified)
  --progress <n>          Report progress every N lines (default: 10)
  --help                  Show help information
```

##### 2b. ðŸ”² New CLI Command: `predict-game`
```
fastbreak-cli predict-game [options]

Options:
  --json <data>           JSON game data for prediction (inline)
  --file <path>           JSON file path containing game data
  --ratings <path>        CSV file with current team ratings (optional, uses latest if not specified)
  --verbose               Include detailed prediction breakdown
  --help                  Show help information

Example JSON Format:
{
  "homeTeam": "Boston Red Sox",
  "awayTeam": "New York Yankees", 
  "weather": { "temperature": 72.0, "windSpeed": 8.5 },
  "homePitcher": { "name": "Chris Sale", "era": 2.85 },
  "awayPitcher": { "name": "Gerrit Cole", "era": 3.20 }
}

Output:
Prediction: New York Yankees (67.3% confidence)
Factors: Elo difference (+45), Pitcher advantage (+12), Weather neutral
```

##### 2c. ðŸ”² New CLI Command: `convert-retrosheet`
```
fastbreak-cli convert-retrosheet [options]

Options:
  --input <path>          Directory containing Retrosheet files (.EVE, .ROS)
  --output <path>         Output CSV file path (default: retrosheet-converted.csv)
  --season <year>         Process specific season (e.g., 2023)
  --seasons <start-end>   Process range of seasons (e.g., 2020-2023)
  --weather               Include weather data estimation (default: false)
  --verbose               Show detailed processing information
  --help                  Show help information

Example Usage:

### ML.NET Model Architecture (Phase 8)

#### Feature Engineering Strategy
```fsharp
type GameFeatures = {
    // Elo-based features
    HomeElo: float32
    AwayElo: float32
    EloDifference: float32
    
    // Weather features (normalized)
    Temperature: float32         // Normalized to 0-1 range
    WindSpeed: float32          // Normalized to 0-1 range
    WindFactor: float32         // Directional wind impact (-1 to 1)
    PrecipitationLevel: float32 // Categorical: 0=none, 0.5=light, 1=heavy
    
    // Pitcher features
    HomeERAAdvantage: float32   // (League avg ERA - Home ERA) / League avg
    AwayERAAdvantage: float32   // (League avg ERA - Away ERA) / League avg
    HomeWHIPAdvantage: float32  // Similar normalization
    AwayWHIPAdvantage: float32
    HomeStrikeoutRate: float32  // K/9 normalized
    AwayStrikeoutRate: float32
    
    // Team offensive features
    OPSDifferential: float32    // HomeOPS - AwayOPS
    ERAPlus Differential: float32 // HomeERA+ - AwayERA+
    FIPDifferential: float32    // AwayFIP - HomeFIP (lower is better)
    
    // Interaction terms
    EloWeatherInteraction: float32      // Elo difference * weather factor
    PitcherMatchupAdvantage: float32    // Combined pitcher advantage score
}

type GamePrediction = {
    HomeWinProbability: float32
    Label: bool  // true = home win, false = away win
}
```

#### Model Training Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert GameData to GameFeatures with normalization
2. **Feature Selection**: Use ML.NET feature importance analysis
3. **Model Training**: Train multiple algorithms in parallel:
   - FastTree (gradient boosting)
   - LightGBM (if available)
   - Logistic Regression (baseline)
4. **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation with temporal splits
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal parameters
6. **Elo+ Integration**: Use model confidence to adjust traditional Elo ratings

#### Performance Targets
- **Accuracy**: >62% on validation set (baseline: ~54% for random)
- **AUC-ROC**: >0.65 (Area Under Curve for binary classification)
- **Precision/Recall**: Balanced performance for both home/away wins
- **Training Speed**: <30 seconds for 10,000 games on standard hardware
