# Fastbreak

A sports analytics platform with advanced Elo+ rating system for baseball analysis.

## Elo+ Rating System Brainstorm

### Overview
The Elo+ system is a two-pass machine learning approach that extends traditional Elo ratings by incorporating advanced baseball analytics and environmental factors.

### Architecture

#### Current CLI Structure
- **F# CLI Application** (`server/src/Fastbreak.Cli/`)
- **Current Commands**: âœ… `generate-elo-plus` 
- **Framework**: Argu for command-line parsing
- **Target**: .NET 9.0

#### Implementation Status

##### 1. âœ… Remove Example Commands
- âœ… Remove existing `Export_Leaderboard` and `Export_Stats` commands
- âœ… Clean up DataExport.fs module (renamed to EloPlus.fs)

##### 2. ðŸ”„ New CLI Command: `generate-elo-plus`
```
fastbreak-cli generate-elo-plus [options]

Options:
  --file <path>           CSV file path for game data (optional, uses sample data if not specified)
  --progress <n>          Report progress every N lines (default: 10)
  --help                  Show help information
```

##### 3. âœ… Game Data Entity
Simple entity structure to represent:
- âœ… Game results (win/loss)
- âœ… Team identifiers
- âœ… Weather data (temperature, wind, precipitation)
- âœ… Pitcher statistics
- âœ… Basic SABR metrics (OPS, ERA+, FIP, etc.)

##### 4. ðŸ”„ Two-Pass Elo Calculation

**âœ… First Pass: Traditional Elo**
- âœ… Input: Game results (wins/losses only)
- âœ… Output: Standard Elo ratings
- âœ… Uses classic Elo algorithm with K-factor adjustment
- âœ… Stores initial ratings for reference

**ðŸ”² Second Pass: Elo+ Enhancement**
- ðŸ”² Input: First pass Elo ratings + enhanced features
- ðŸ”² Features: Weather conditions, pitcher data, SABR metrics
- ðŸ”² Uses .NET ML framework for machine learning model
- ðŸ”² Output: Enhanced Elo+ ratings

##### 5. ðŸ”² Data Storage & Persistence
- ðŸ”² **Model Storage**: Serialize ML.NET model for incremental training
- ðŸ”² **Rating Storage**: Store both Elo and Elo+ ratings
- âœ… **Precision**: Ratings stored to hundredths (0.01) decimal places
- ðŸ”² **Historical Data**: Maintain rating progression over time

##### 6. ðŸ”„ Technology Stack
- âœ… **.NET ML**: Microsoft's machine learning framework (package added)
- âœ… **F# Records**: Immutable data structures for game entities
- âœ… **MongoDB**: Existing database for persistence (package available)
- ðŸ”² **Incremental Learning**: Support for adding new data to existing model

### Implementation Plan

1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Clean existing CLI and add basic structure
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Create game data entities and sample data
3. âœ… **Phase 3**: Implement first-pass traditional Elo calculation
4. ðŸ”² **Phase 4**: Add file input support for CSV data
   - Add `--file` option to CLI command
   - Support for reading CSV game data instead of sample data
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing sample data
5. ðŸ”² **Phase 5**: Create CSV sample data file
   - Generate realistic CSV file with game data
   - Include all required fields: teams, scores, weather, pitcher stats, SABR metrics
   - Stream-friendly format for large datasets
6. ðŸ”² **Phase 6**: Add streaming and progress reporting
   - Stream CSV file processing (don't load entire file into memory)
   - Progress reporting every 10th line (configurable via CLI option)
   - Error handling and reporting for malformed data
   - Performance metrics: total games processed and processing time
7. ðŸ”² **Phase 7**: Build ML.NET model for second-pass enhancement
8. ðŸ”² **Phase 8**: Add model persistence and rating storage
9. ðŸ”² **Phase 9**: Testing and validation with larger datasets

### Sample Data Structure

```fsharp
type GameData = {
    GameId: string
    HomeTeam: string
    AwayTeam: string
    HomeScore: int
    AwayScore: int
    Date: DateTime
    Weather: WeatherData option
    HomePitcher: PitcherData option
    AwayPitcher: PitcherData option
    Metrics: SabrMetrics option
}

type WeatherData = {
    Temperature: float
    WindSpeed: float
    WindDirection: string
    Precipitation: float
}

type EloRating = {
    Team: string
    StandardElo: decimal
    EloPlus: decimal option
    LastUpdated: DateTime
}
```

### Success Metrics
- âœ… Accurate Elo calculations matching traditional implementations
- âœ… Performance suitable for batch processing of historical data
- âœ… Ratings stored with proper precision
- ðŸ”² CSV file streaming and progress reporting
- ðŸ”² Error handling for malformed data
- ðŸ”² ML model successfully incorporates additional features
- ðŸ”² Model can be retrained with new data

### Expected CSV Format

```csv
GameId,Date,HomeTeam,AwayTeam,HomeScore,AwayScore,Temperature,WindSpeed,WindDirection,Precipitation,HomePitcherName,HomePitcherERA,HomePitcherWHIP,HomePitcherK,HomePitcherBB,HomePitcherIP,AwayPitcherName,AwayPitcherERA,AwayPitcherWHIP,AwayPitcherK,AwayPitcherBB,AwayPitcherIP,HomeOPS,AwayOPS,HomeERAPlus,AwayERAPlus,HomeFIP,AwayFIP
2024-04-15-NYY-BOS,2024-04-15,Boston Red Sox,New York Yankees,7,4,72.0,8.5,SW,0.0,Ace Starter,2.85,1.12,185,45,210.1,Control Lefty,3.42,1.25,142,38,178.2,0.785,0.732,112,98,3.45,4.12
```

### Performance Expectations
- **Streaming Processing**: Handle files of any size without memory constraints
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time feedback for long-running operations
- **Error Resilience**: Continue processing after encountering malformed lines
- **Performance Metrics**: Track processing speed and completion statistics

This system will provide enhanced baseball team ratings that go beyond simple win/loss records to include the rich contextual data that affects game outcomes.
