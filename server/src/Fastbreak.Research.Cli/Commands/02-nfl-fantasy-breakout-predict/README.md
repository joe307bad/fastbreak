# NFL Fantasy Breakout Prediction CLI

A machine learning-powered CLI tool that analyzes NFL fantasy football data to predict player breakouts using both composite scoring and ML methodologies.

## Overview

This command analyzes CSV data from the R-based fantasy breakout prediction pipeline to train and evaluate models that predict when second-year NFL players will have breakout fantasy performances. It compares traditional composite scoring approaches against machine learning models to determine which methodology performs better.

## Usage

```bash
dotnet run 02-nfl-fantasy-breakout --data /path/to/csv/directory --output /path/to/output.json
```

### Arguments

- `--data` (required): Directory path containing CSV files from the fantasy breakout prediction pipeline
- `--output` (required): Path where the weekly metrics JSON file should be saved

### Example

```bash
dotnet run 02-nfl-fantasy-breakout --data /Users/joebad/Source/fastbreak/pipeline/02-fantasy-breakout-predict/sleeper_analysis_2024 --output /Users/joebad/Source/fastbreak/pipeline/02-fantasy-breakout-predict/sleeper_analysis_2024/weekly_metrics.json
```

## Complete Execution Workflow

To generate weekly performance analysis and visualization:

### Step 1: Generate Weekly Metrics JSON
Run the F# command to analyze data and generate weekly hit counts:

```bash
cd server/src/Fastbreak.Research.Cli
dotnet run 02-nfl-fantasy-breakout --data /path/to/sleeper_analysis_2024 --output /path/to/output/weekly_metrics.json
```

This generates:
- Model performance analysis and comparison
- Weekly metrics JSON file at the specified output location with three metrics per week:
  - Top 10 sleeper score hits
  - Top 3 sleeper score hits
  - ML model successful predictions

### Step 2: Generate Visualization
Run the R script to create a comparative line graph:

```bash
cd pipeline/02-fantasy-breakout-predict
Rscript scripts/plot_weekly_metrics.R sleeper_analysis_2024/weekly_metrics.csv output_plot.png
```

This produces:
- Multi-line graph comparing the three performance metrics over time
- Summary statistics and efficiency ratios
- High-resolution PNG plot for analysis

## What It Does

### 1. **Data Analysis**
- Loads and analyzes training data files (`*_raw.csv`) containing 60+ features per player
- Loads sleeper score files (`*.csv`) containing composite rankings and hit status
- Provides comprehensive data overview including file counts, record counts, and feature analysis

### 2. **Breakout Detection**
- Uses a configurable **5.0 fantasy point threshold** to define breakouts
- Identifies players who increased their fantasy points by 5+ from the previous week
- Analyzes breakout patterns across weeks 3-17 of the NFL season

### 3. **Model Training & Comparison**
- **70/30 Data Split**: 70% for training, 30% for testing
- **Sleeper Score Model**: Uses composite score with 100-point threshold
- **ML Model**: Combines sleeper score (60%) + playing time (20%) + momentum (20%)
- Trains both models on the same data for fair comparison

### 4. **Performance Evaluation**
- Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for both methodologies
- Provides confusion matrix analysis
- Determines statistical winner based on test set performance

### 5. **Prediction Analysis**
- Shows top 10 predicted breakouts with confidence scores
- Identifies missed breakouts (actual breakouts not predicted)
- Provides player-level insights for fantasy decision making

### 6. **Weekly Metrics JSON Generation**
- Generates weekly metrics JSON at the specified output path containing hit counts for visualization
- Tracks three performance metrics across all NFL weeks:
  - Top 10 sleeper score hits per week
  - Top 3 sleeper score hits per week
  - ML model successful predictions per week
- Enables comparative analysis of methodology performance over time

- Generated by the R-based fantasy breakout prediction pipeline

### Sleeper Score Files (`*.csv`)
- **21 columns** including sleeper rankings and hit status
- Key columns: `sleeper_rank`, `player`, `position`, `hit_status`, `sleeper_score`
- Contains composite scoring results from R analysis

## Key Metrics

- **Breakout Threshold**: 5.0 fantasy points increase from previous week
- **Data Split**: 70% training, 30% testing (with random seed for reproducibility)
- **Success Criteria**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score comparisons

- **Features**:
  - Sleeper score (60% weight)
  - Playing time indicator (20% weight)
  - Performance momentum (20% weight)
- **Threshold**: 0.5 combined score

## Use Cases

1. **Fantasy Football Analysis**: Identify undervalued players likely to break out
2. **Methodology Research**: Compare traditional vs ML approaches in sports analytics
