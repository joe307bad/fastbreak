## March Madness features

A dedicated March Madness experience that tracks team performance metrics throughout the tournament, allowing users to compare matchups and identify potential upsets based on historical trends and current form. This would help fans and analysts make more informed predictions by surfacing key statistical advantages and weaknesses in bracket scenarios.

## More NBA/NHL charts that include matchup worksheets that integrate the result of the matchup as the week progresses

Enhanced matchup worksheets that dynamically update as games conclude, showing how pre-game predictions compared to actual outcomes. This feature would allow users to track the accuracy of their analysis over time and refine their understanding of which metrics are most predictive. By comparing expected vs. actual performance, analysts can identify when teams are trending above or below their statistical projections.

## 3 week trend charts for players/teams

Visualizations that show performance trajectories over a three-week rolling window, making it easier to spot hot and cold streaks before they become obvious. This mid-range timeframe is particularly valuable for identifying sustainable performance changes versus random variance. Users can quickly see which players are trending up or down.

## Web project parity: sharing, filtering, matchup worksheets, pinning teams and storing in local storage

Bringing the mobile app's most powerful features to the web platform, including the ability to share custom visualizations with colleagues, filter data by relevant parameters, create detailed matchup analysis worksheets, and save favorite teams for quick access. This cross-platform consistency ensures analysts can seamlessly transition between devices while maintaining their personalized workflow. Local storage of preferences means users can build a curated analytics experience tailored to the teams and metrics they care about most.

## AI generated "topics of the day/week"

An LLM-powered analysis engine that automatically reviews the latest statistical trends and generates talking points highlighting the most interesting storylines. This feature would save analysts hours of manual chart review by surfacing noteworthy patterns like unusual team performance, breakout player performances, or significant tactical shifts. The AI can identify correlations and anomalies that might be missed in manual review, ensuring users never miss important developments.

## Push notifications when there are updated charts

Real-time alerts when new statistical visualizations are published or existing charts receive significant updates with fresh data. This keeps analysts informed the moment new insights become available, allowing them to stay ahead of the news cycle and react to developing trends before they become widely known. Users can customize notification preferences to receive alerts only for specific sports, teams, or chart types they follow most closely.

## Selectable themes for major teams

Allowing users to select a theme that correlates to a given team, with that theme affecting the entire fastbreak UI. This personalization feature would let fans show their team loyalty while using the app, with color schemes, accents, and design elements reflecting their favorite team's branding. The theming system would maintain readability and usability while creating a more immersive experience that connects users emotionally to the analytics they're viewing.
