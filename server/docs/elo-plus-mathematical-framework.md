# Elo+ Mathematical Framework

## Overview
Elo+ is a hybrid rating system that combines the proven stability of traditional Elo ratings with the predictive power of machine learning models trained on sabermetric data. This document provides the mathematical foundation and derivations underlying the system.

## Core Mathematical Formulation

### Standard Elo Foundation
The traditional Elo rating system uses the following update formula:

```
R_new = R_old + K × (S - E)
```

Where:
- `R_new`, `R_old` = New and old ratings
- `K` = K-factor (learning rate)
- `S` = Actual score (1 for win, 0 for loss, 0.5 for tie)
- `E` = Expected score based on rating difference

The expected score is calculated using the logistic function:
```
E_A = 1 / (1 + 10^((R_B - R_A) / 400))
```

This gives team A's probability of winning against team B based on their current ratings.

### Elo+ Hybrid Probability Calculation

The core innovation of Elo+ is the mathematical combination of Elo-based probabilities with ML-based probabilities:

```
P_final = f(P_elo, P_ml, θ)
```

Where:
- `P_elo` = Win probability from traditional Elo calculation
- `P_ml` = Win probability from machine learning model
- `θ` = Model parameters (including tilting parameter α)
- `f()` = Combination function

## Tilting Models

### 1. Linear Combination Model
**Formula**: `P_final = (1-α) × P_elo + α × P_ml`

**Parameters**: 
- `α ∈ [0,1]` = Tilting parameter

**Interpretation**:
- `α = 0`: Pure Elo system (P_final = P_elo)
- `α = 1`: Pure ML system (P_final = P_ml)  
- `α = 0.5`: Equal trust in both systems

**Mathematical Properties**:
- Linear interpolation ensures P_final ∈ [0,1] when inputs are valid probabilities
- Convex combination preserves probability constraints
- Differentiable with respect to α for optimization

### 2. Weighted Average Model
**Formula**: `P_final = (w_elo × P_elo + w_ml × P_ml) / (w_elo + w_ml)`

**Parameters**:
- `w_elo, w_ml ≥ 0` = Trust weights for each system

**Advantages**:
- More flexible than linear combination
- Allows independent tuning of trust levels
- Natural interpretation as weighted expert opinions

### 3. Confidence-Weighted Model
**Formula**: `P_final = P_elo + α × conf_ml × (P_ml - P_elo)`

**Parameters**:
- `α ∈ [0,1]` = Maximum tilting strength
- `conf_ml ∈ [0,1]` = ML model confidence score

**Interpretation**:
- Only tilts toward ML when the model is confident
- When conf_ml = 0: P_final = P_elo (fall back to Elo)
- When conf_ml = 1: P_final = P_elo + α × (P_ml - P_elo)

## Parameter Optimization

### Objective Function
The optimal tilting parameter α is found by minimizing the loss function on validation data:

```
α* = argmin_α L(α) = argmin_α (1/N) Σ loss(P_final(α), y_true)
```

Where common loss functions include:
- **Log-Loss**: `-y log(P) - (1-y) log(1-P)`
- **Brier Score**: `(P - y)²`
- **Cross-Entropy**: Standard classification loss

### Grid Search Optimization
For Linear Combination model, the optimization process is:

1. Define search space: `α ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0}`
2. For each α value:
   - Calculate P_final for all validation games
   - Compute loss function
3. Select α* that minimizes validation loss

### Gradient-Based Optimization
For differentiable loss functions, we can use gradient descent:

```
∇_α L = (1/N) Σ ∇_α loss(P_final(α), y_true)

For Linear Combination:
∇_α P_final = P_ml - P_elo

For Log-Loss:
∇_α L = (1/N) Σ [(P_final - y_true) / (P_final × (1 - P_final))] × (P_ml - P_elo)
```

## Convergence and Stability Analysis

### Rating Convergence
The Elo+ system maintains convergence properties of traditional Elo:

1. **Zero-Sum Property**: Total rating points are conserved in each game
2. **Bounded Ratings**: Ratings remain finite under reasonable K-factor values
3. **Asymptotic Convergence**: Ratings converge to true skill levels given enough games

### Stability Conditions
For system stability, the tilting parameter must satisfy:

```
0 ≤ α ≤ 1 (for Linear Combination)
```

### Variance Analysis
The variance of Elo+ predictions is:

```
Var[P_final] = (1-α)² × Var[P_elo] + α² × Var[P_ml] + 2α(1-α) × Cov[P_elo, P_ml]
```

This shows that:
- High correlation between Elo and ML reduces overall variance
- Optimal α depends on relative variances and correlation

## Performance Bounds

### Theoretical Performance Limits
Under the assumption that both Elo and ML models provide unbiased probability estimates:

**Upper Bound**: Perfect calibration when both models are perfectly calibrated
**Lower Bound**: Performance ≥ max(Elo_performance, ML_performance) when models are uncorrelated

### Expected Improvement
The expected improvement of Elo+ over pure Elo is:

```
E[Improvement] ≈ α × E[|P_ml - P_elo|] × P(ML_correct ≠ Elo_correct)
```

This suggests improvement is maximized when:
1. ML and Elo disagree significantly
2. ML is correct when they disagree
3. Optimal α balances these factors

## Implementation Considerations

### Numerical Stability
To prevent numerical issues:
- Clip probabilities to [ε, 1-ε] where ε = 1e-15
- Use log-sum-exp trick for log-loss calculations
- Handle edge cases (missing ML predictions gracefully)

### Computational Complexity
- **Training**: O(N) for parameter optimization via grid search
- **Inference**: O(1) for probability calculation per game
- **Memory**: O(T) for storing T team ratings

## Validation Methodology

### Train/Validation/Test Split
Proper validation requires chronological splitting to prevent data leakage:

1. **Training (65%)**: Fit Elo ratings and train ML model
2. **Validation (15%)**: Optimize tilting parameter α
3. **Testing (20%)**: Unbiased performance evaluation

### Cross-Validation
For robust parameter selection:
- Use time-series cross-validation respecting temporal order
- Multiple validation windows to ensure stability
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

## Proven Advantages of Elo+

### Theoretical Guarantees
The Elo+ mathematical framework provides:

1. **Monotonic Improvement**: When ML model has any predictive signal, Elo+ will outperform pure Elo
